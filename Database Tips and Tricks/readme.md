# Database Tips and Tricks   

This directory has mishmash of different items, ranging from tips and tricks, my writings on various database topics, and a few Azure end to end demos I have created.

Many of these items are solutions to everyday problems that I encounter in my daily SQL activities.  Feel free to rummage around. I've tried my best to include detailed yet brief instructions for each of my scripts.

⌨️&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All SQL is written in Microsoft SQL Server T-SQL, unless otherwise noted.
