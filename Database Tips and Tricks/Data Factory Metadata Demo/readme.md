# Data Factory Metadata Demo   

This directory contains a demo to understand what metadata is available with Azure Data Factory.

## About

In this demo, I create several pipelines to import text files into a SQL Server database and append all Azure Data Factory metadata from both the text files 
and the Data Factory pipeline.

This demo covers the following topics:    
*  File and Data Factory Pipeline Metadata
*  Parameters and Variables
*  User-Defined Table Types

## Getting Started

To get started, download the `Data Factory Metadata Demo PDF.pdf` and follow along with each slide.

In this directory, you will find the following files:    
*  Sample text files (`Customer_1.txt`,`Customer_2.txt`,`Customer_3.txt`) that we will import using Azure Data Factory.
*  A script (`Data Factory SQL DDL Scripts.sql`) to create the tables and stored procedure we will use in this demo.

I've also included the PowerPoint presentation (`Data Factory MetaData Demo PowerPoint.pptx`) that you can download and add notes or modify as needed.
