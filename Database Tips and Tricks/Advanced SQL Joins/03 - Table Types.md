# Table Types

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within SQL, you can create a join to the following 10 table types. Table types can be schema-bound objects, meaning they are saved as a database object within a named schema, or they are unbound and only durable for the life of an SQL statement or your current session.  Items that are not schema-bound are created in the `tempdb` and do not have any data of their existence in the catalog views.

Here are the 10 different types of tables you can create.

| Id |              Name              |  Schema Bound |                                                                 Description                                                                |
|----|--------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Table                          | True          | A regular table that is stored in the database.                                                                                            |
| 2  | View                           | True          | A virtual table that is based on the result of a `SELECT` statement.                                                                       |
| 3  | Values Constructor             | False         | The `VALUES` constructor can be used to create a derived table, which is a table that is created and used within a single SQL query.       |
| 4  | Table Valued Function          | True          | A function that returns a table as its result.                                                                                             |
| 5  | Subquery                       | False         | A query that is embedded within another query. The results of a subquery can be used in the outer query.                                   |
| 6  | Derived Table                  | False         | A special type of subquery that is defined in the `FROM` statement                                                                         |
| 7  | Common Table Expression (CTE)  | False         | A named temporary result set that can be used in a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.                                    |
| 8  | Temporary Table                | False         | A table that is created for a specific session or connection and is automatically dropped when the session or connection ends.             |
| 9  | Table Variable                 | False         | A variable that holds a table of data. It is similar to a temporary table, but it has some differences in behavior and scope.              |
|10  | External Tables                | False         | Used to access data stored externally, such as Hadoop or Azure Blob storage. They are created using the `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` statement.               |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Tempdb` is used by SQL Server to store intermediate results when processing queries, such as those created by derived tables and subqueries. This allows the database engine to reuse the results multiple times in the same query instead of recomputing them each time they're needed. It's important to note that the use of `tempdb` and the extent to which it's used can vary depending on the complexity of the query and other factors, such as the amount of memory available and the indexes present on the involved tables.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most interesting of these table types is the `VALUES` keyword.  We often think the only use of the `VALUES` operator is using it with an `INSERT` statement, but it can be used to create a relation.  

First, let's create examples of each of the table types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Table

The type of table referred to below is a base table. A base table is a permanent table stored in the database and contains the actual data in the form of rows and columns. The `SELECT *` statement retrieves all columns and all rows from the table. On base tables, you can implement `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `CHECK`, and `DEFAULT` constraints.

In this example, we create a table named `Employees`, insert a record using the `VALUES` constructor, and then select from the table. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees
(
EmployeeID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
FirstName  VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
LastName   VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Department VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Salary     MONEY NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department,Salary) VALUES (1,'John','Wilson','Accounting',100000);
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department,Salary) VALUES (2,'Sarah','Shultz','Accounting',90000);

SELECT * FROM Employees;
```


| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Department |  Salary   |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
|          1 | John      | Wilson   | Accounting | 100000.00 |
|          2 | Sarah     | Shultz   | Accounting |  90000.00 |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### View

An SQL view is a virtual table that provides a specific, customized data perspective from one or more tables in a database.  There are two main types of SQL views: materialized views and non-materialized (or simple) views. Materialized views store the result set of the view query, while non-materialized views do not store any data and dynamically retrieve data from the underlying tables each time the view is accessed.  You can issue `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` commands through views and can manipulate the underlying table(s) in the view.

In this example, we create a view from the `Employees` table, insert a record into the table, and then select from the view;

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vwEmployees AS
(
SELECT  EmployeeID,
        FirstName,
        LastName,
        Department,
        Salary
FROM    Employees
);

INSERT INTO vwEmployees (EmployeeID,FirstName,LastName, Department,Salary) VALUES(3,'Larry','Johnson','Accounting','85000');

SELECT * FROM vwEmployees;
```

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Department |  Salary   |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | Accounting | 100000.00 |
| 2          | Sarah     | Shultz   | Accounting |  90000.00 |
| 3          | Larry     | Johnson  | Accounting |  85000.00 |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### VALUES Operator

The `VALUES` constructor has a few considerations that are often overlooked and deserve its own recognition.  The `VALUES` constructor specifies a set of row value expressions to be constructed into a table and allows multiple sets of values to be specified in a single DML statement.  Normally, we use the `VALUES` constructor to specify the data to insert into a table, as we initially did with our test data, but it can also be used as a derived table in an SQL statement.

Here is a basic example of using the `VALUES` constructor as a derived table.

```sql
SELECT  a,
        b 
FROM    (VALUES (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10)) AS MyTable(a, b);
```

| a | b  |
|---|----|
| 1 | 2  |
| 3 | 4  |
| 5 | 6  |
| 7 | 8  |
| 9 | 10 |

Here is a more elaborate example where the `VALUES` constructor specifies the values to return.

```sql
SELECT  a.*
FROM    Employees a INNER JOIN
        (VALUES (1), (2)) AS b(EmployeeID) ON a.EmployeeID = b.EmployeeID;
```

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Department |  Salary   |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | Accounting | 100000.00 |
| 2          | Sarah     | Shultz   | Accounting |  90000.00 |


You can also place functions into the `VALUES` constructor.  The `NEWID()` function creates a unique value of type `UNIQUEIDENTIFIER`.

```sql
SELECT  CONCAT(FirstName,' ',LastName) AS Name,
        b.UniqueID
FROM    Employees a CROSS JOIN
        (VALUES (NEWID())) AS b(UniqueID);
```

|     Name      |               UniqueID               |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| John Wilson   | 50CA5F8E-9090-4DB8-A7C4-43F1D6C89D57 |
| Sarah Shultz  | 803DF712-0144-41AC-959A-A774F35DC600 |
| Larry Johnson | 5CCCCBE3-F600-4E79-B16B-1BC6504152A2 |


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Table-Valued Function

A table-valued function acts like a view with the added benefit of being parameterized.  

For this example, we create a table-valued function using the `Employees` table.  To use the table values function, we can simply select from the function or use the `CROSS APPLY` join operation.
        
```sql
CREATE OR ALTER FUNCTION FnGetEmployees (@EmployeeID INTEGER)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(
SELECT EmployeeID, Name
FROM   Employees
WHERE  EmployeeID = @EmployeeID
);

SELECT * FROM fnGetEmployees(1);

SELECT  a.*
FROM    Employees a CROSS APPLY
        fnGetEmployees(1);
```

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Department |  Salary   |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | Accounting | 100000.00 |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Subquery

A subquery is a query nested within another query. 

Subqueries can be used in various parts of a SQL query, such as the `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` clauses. They are highly useful for performing operations that require multiple scans of the same or different tables, complex calculations, or referencing results that are not part of the main query. They are highly useful for performing operations that require multiple scans of the same or different tables, complex calculations, or referencing results that are not part of the main query.

Here is an example of a correlated subquery using the `Employees` table.  We will talk more about correlated subqueries in the Semi and Anti join portion of this repository.

```sql
SELECT  e.*
FROM    Employees e
WHERE   e.Salary >  (SELECT AVG(Salary)
                     FROM Employees
                     WHERE Department = e.Department);
```

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Department |  Salary   |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | Accounting | 100000.00 |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Derived Table

A derived table is an expression that generates a table within the scope of the `FROM` clause.  It is a special type of subquery.  

A derived table has three characteristics:
1) Defined in the `FROM` clause
2) Surrounded in parenthesis
3) Has a table alias

Here is an example of a derived table in SQL.

    
```sql
SELECT  e.*,
        e2.EmployeeID,
        e2.Salary
FROM    (SELECT  EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary FROM Employees) e 
        INNER JOIN 
        Employees e2 ON e.Salary > e2.Salary;      
```

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName |  Salary   | EmployeeID |  Salary  |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | 100000.00 | 2          | 90000.00 |
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | 100000.00 | 3          | 85000.00 |
| 2          | Sarah     | Shultz   | 90000.00  | 3          | 85000.00 |

In Microsoft SQL Server, even when performing a `CROSS JOIN`, the derived table must be aliased.  This statement will error if the table alias is removed.  For brevity, I only show the top two records.

```sql
SELECT  TOP 2 *
FROM    (SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employees) e
        CROSS JOIN
        Employees;
```

|  Salary  | EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Department |  Salary   |
|----------|------------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 85000.00 | 1          | John      | Wilson   | Accounting | 100000.00 |
| 85000.00 | 2          | Sarah     | Shultz   | Accounting |  90000.00 |
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Common Table Expression (CTE) 

A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a named, temporary result set that is defined within a `SELECT` statement

```sql        
WITH EmployeesByDepartment AS 
(
SELECT  Department, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM    Employees
GROUP BY Department
)
SELECT  Department, EmployeeCount
FROM    EmployeesByDepartment
WHERE   EmployeeCount > 2;
```

| Department | EmployeeCount |
|------------|---------------|
| Accounting | 3             |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Temporary Table        

The syntax for creating temporary tables is different for each database system.  These examples work in Microsoft SQL Server.

Session temporary tables and global temporary tables are two types of temporary tables in SQL. The main difference between them is their scope and visibility.  

*  In Microsoft SQL Server, you can use a single octothorpe (#) for a session temporary table and two octothorpes (##) for a global session table.
*  Session temporary tables are only visible to the user who created them and are automatically dropped when the user's session ends.  
*  Global temporary tables are available to every user's session.  
*  You can place the same constraints, except for `FOREIGN KEY` constraints, on a temp table as you can on a permanent table.  
*  Indexing is allowed on temporary tables.
*  Temporary tables reside in `tempdb`, and you cannot see the table's metadata in the information schema.

This creates a session temporary table in SQL Server.

```sql
CREATE TABLE #Employees
(
EmployeeID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
FirstName  VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
LastName   VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Department VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Salary     MONEY NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO #Employees SELECT * FROM Employees;

SELECT * FROM #Employees;
```sql

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName |  Salary   | EmployeeID |  Salary  |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | 100000.00 | 2          | 90000.00 |
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | 100000.00 | 3          | 85000.00 |
| 2          | Sarah     | Shultz   | 90000.00  | 3          | 85000.00 |
```

You can also create temporary tables via the `INTO` statement in a SQL statement.  This works in Microsoft SQL Server, and each database system has slightly different syntax for temporary tables.

```sql
SELECT  *
INTO    #Employees2
FROM    Employees;

SELECT * FROM #Employees2
```

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName |  Salary   | EmployeeID |  Salary  |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | 100000.00 | 2          | 90000.00 |
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | 100000.00 | 3          | 85000.00 |
| 2          | Sarah     | Shultz   | 90000.00  | 3          | 85000.00 |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Table Variable   

Table variables are much like temporary tables.  They are used when passing a record set to a stored procedure.  Each database may implement table variables slightly differently, but Microsoft SQL Server has the following considerations.

*  You can place constraints on the table except for `FOREIGN KEY` constraints.
*  The constraints must be placed on the table on creation.
*  You cannot alter the table variable once it is created.
*  You cannot create an explicit index on a table variable.
*  When creating a `PRIMARY KEY` or a `UNIQUE` constraint, an index is created.
*  The `TRUNCATE` statement does not work on table variables.
*  Table variables are stored in `tempdb`.

```sql
DECLARE @TableVariable Table
(
EmployeeID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
FirstName  VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
LastName   VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Department VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Salary     MONEY NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO @TableVariable
SELECT * FROM Employees;

SELECT * FROM @TableVariable;
```

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName |  Salary   | EmployeeID |  Salary  |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | 100000.00 | 2          | 90000.00 |
| 1          | John      | Wilson   | 100000.00 | 3          | 85000.00 |
| 2          | Sarah     | Shultz   | 90000.00  | 3          | 85000.00 |


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### External Tables           

External tables in Microsoft SQL Server exist outside of the database and are used to access data stored in external sources such as Hadoop or Azure Blob storage. External tables provide a way to access external data as if it were a regular table within the database, allowing you to use standard SQL statements to retrieve and manipulate data stored in external sources. This can be useful for tasks such as performing data integration, bulk data loading, and data archiving, as well as for querying and processing large datasets stored in external sources. However, external tables in Microsoft SQL Server have limitations such as limited indexing options and slower query performance compared to regular tables stored in the SQL Server database.

See your vendor's documentation on external tables, as this will vary for each vendor.

The Microsoft SQL Server documentation has the following examples.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE mydatasource
WITH (
    TYPE = HADOOP,
    LOCATION = 'hdfs://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8020'
);

CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT myfileformat
WITH (
    FORMAT_TYPE = DELIMITEDTEXT,
    FORMAT_OPTIONS (FIELD_TERMINATOR ='|')
);

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ClickStream (
    url varchar(50),
    event_date date,
    user_IP varchar(50)
)
WITH (
        LOCATION='/webdata/employee.tbl',
        DATA_SOURCE = mydatasource,
        FILE_FORMAT = myfileformat
    );
```
