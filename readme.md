## Content
The contents of this GitHub continue to expand, so check back often. Below are some of the most popular directories:

*  [Advanced SQL Puzzles](/Advanced%20SQL%20Puzzles): A growing collection of my SQL puzzles.  I'm always looking for new puzzles, so please share if you have anything that would be a great fit.  
*  [Recursion Examples](/Advanced%20SQL%20Puzzles/Recursion%20Examples): My collection of SQL queries that use recursion.  Here I solve all sorts of problems such as Markov chains, floor and ceiling caps, Traveling Salesman, and even one for Sudoku.    
*  [Advanced SQL Joins](/Database%20Tips%20and%20Tricks/Advanced%20SQL%20Joins): Ever wanted to know all about semi-joins, anti-joins, equi-joins, theta-joins, self-joins, and all the ways you will encounter the word "join" in your daily SQL activities, then this is the directory for you!    
*  [Behavior of Nulls](/Database%20Tips%20and%20Tricks/Behavior%20Of%20Nulls):  NULL markers are the bane of every developer, so I compiled a list of all the different SQL constructs and how they handle NULL markers.    
*  [Databricks Hive Demo](/Database%20Tips%20and%20Tricks/Databricks%20Hive%20Demo):  Setting up Databricks to connect to an Azure Data Lake and SQL Server is no easy task, so I created an end-to-end demo showing how to set everything up.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Scott Peters, an experienced SQL developer based in Austin, Texas. With over two decades of experience in the field, I've honed my skills in designing, developing, and maintaining complex databases, with a focus on the financial industry.   

My strengths lie in my ability to think in a set-based manner, grasp the relational model, and tackle complex data puzzles. I'm also skilled in technical writing, which has allowed me to effectively document my work.   

I am always eager to collaborate with fellow SQL developers. If you would like to connect, feel free to drop me a line!
