# Advanced SQL Puzzles

This directory contains my collection of SQL puzzles.  I hope you enjoy these puzzles as much as I have enjoyed creating them!

To get started, download the `Advanced SQL Puzzles.pdf`. 

:keyboard:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solutions provided are written in Microsoft SQL Server T-SQL, but you can easily modify them to fit your flavor of SQL.

:question:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any questions, please feel free to create a GitHub discussion.  I am always happy to help out and explain different solutions.

## About

As my list of puzzles continues to grow, I have decided to combine the puzzles into one single PDF document broken down into two different sections.

*  In the first section, I have 64 of the most difficult puzzles I could create, randomly organized and in no specific order.  These are primarily set-based puzzles, interspersed with a small number of puzzles that require knowledge of constraints, specific data types, cursors, loops, etc...

*  In the second set of puzzles, I have collected all the puzzles related to permutations, combinations, and sequences. Solving these puzzles will require a deeper knowledge of your SQL thinking, focusing on such constructs as using recursion or sequence objects to reach the desired output.

## Getting Started

To get started, download the `Advanced SQL Puzzles.pdf`. 

*  Solutions are provided in the `Advanced SQL Puzzles Solutions.sql` script
*  If you want the `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements without the solutions, see the script `Advanced SQL Puzzles DDL.sql`.
*  Solutions for the second set of puzzles are located in the directory `Part II`.
*  I also keep my collection of SQL statements using recursion in the directory `Recursion Examples`.  Here you can find out how to solve [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain), solve the [Traveling Salesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) problem, calculate floor and ceiling caps, or find a solution to a [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) puzzle.
