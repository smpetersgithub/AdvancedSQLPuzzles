# ANY, ALL, and SOME

‚ùó **`SOME` and `ANY` are equivalent; for this document I will use `ANY`.**

`ANY`, `ALL`, and `SOME` compare a scalar value with a single column set of values. 

---------------------------------------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because `ANY`, `ALL`, and `SOME` can be used with the nine different logical operators below, there can be a total of 27 combinations.  Plus they can be negated with the `NOT` operator leading to even more combinations.  Most of the usages have equivalents that are easy to understand, and I have found the best way to understand `ANY`, `ALL`, and `SOME` is by using the `IF` keyword to review their usage and provide an equivalent statement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ANY`, `ALL`, and `SOME` are not join types, but rather methods for creating predicate logic between tables. They can be utilized in correlated subqueries, where the outer query is joined to the subquery involved in the `ANY`, `ALL`, or `SOME` statement. These methods are similar to semi and anti-joins in that they cannot be used in the `SELECT` clause and do not introduce duplicates. However, they differ in that they allow for comparisons between a range of values, rather than only equality or inequality.

---------------------------------------------------------

Here are the nine different comparison operators that can be used with `ANY`, `ALL`, and `SOME`.

There are two usages, `<> ANY` and `= ALL`, that I will further elaborate on, as these have special use cases that I feel are best practices to use rather than their equivalents.

| Operator | Description                         |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| =        | Equal To                            |
| >        | Greater Than                        |
| <        | Less Than                           |
| >=       | Greater Than Or Equal To            |
| <=       | Less Than Or Equal To               |
| <>       | Not Equal To                        |
| !=       | Not Equal To (not ISO standard)     |
| !<       | Not Less Than (not ISO standard)    |
| !>       | Not Greater Than (not ISO standard) |


I have found understanding these nine operations will easily allow you to understand any combination you will see in your daily SQL activities.  I have included the SQL statements below to review these operations.

| Id |     Operation     |             Equivalent                                      |

| 2  | <> ALL            |  NOT IN                                                     |
| 3  | > ALL             |  > MAX                                                      |
| 4  | < ALL             |  < MIN                                                      |
| 5  | = ANY             |  IN                                                         |
| 6  | <> ANY            |  NOT(= ALL), <> MIN OR <> MAX, TOP 1 using a theta-join     | 
| 7  | > ANY             |  > MIN                                                      |
| 8  | < ANY             |  < MAX                                                      |
| 9  | >= ANY AND <= ANY |  BETWEEN and the MIN/MAX functions                          |

### Example 1: Use Cases for = ALL and <> ANY

The following are examples of the `= ALL` and `<> ANY` operators.

You are given the following example table of runtime statuses. Provide an SQL statement that generates the required output.

*  If all the statuses are completed, print "True", else print "False"
*  If all the statuses are not completed, print "True", else print "False".

This example table has statuses that are all completed.

| ID |  Status   |
|----|-----------|
| 1  | Completed |
| 2  | Completed |
| 3  | Completed |
| 4  | Completed |

This example table has statuses that are not all completed.

| ID |  Status   |
|----|-----------|
| 1  | Completed |
| 2  | Completed |
| 3  | Running   |
| 4  | Completed |

Here are the SQL statements (along with the DDL) that produce the required output.

```sql
CREATE TABLE #Status
(
ID  INTEGER IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
Status VARCHAR(10)
);

INSERT INTO #Status (Status) VALUES ('Completed'),('Completed'),('Completed'),('Completed');
GO

IF 'Completed' = ALL (SELECT Status FROM #Status)
PRINT 'TRUE'
ELSE
PRINT 'FALSE';

TRUNCATE TABLE #Status
INSERT INTO #Status (Status) VALUES ('Completed'),('Error'),('Running'),('Completed');
GO

IF 'Completed' <> ANY (SELECT Status FROM #Status)
PRINT 'TRUE'
ELSE
PRINT 'FALSE';
```

### Example 2: Use Cases for = ALL

Here is another (more elaborate) example using the `= ALL` operator with a correlated subquery.  Feel free to modify the data and the requirements to experiment with different ways to produce the expected output.
        
Given the following tables: `Sales Representatives` and `Top Selling Products by Quarter`; calculate the following commissions for the year.

*  If all the top-selling products for the quarter are from one region only, all sales representatives from that region receive a $1000 bonus.
*  If the top-selling products for the quarter are from different regions, all sales representatives from those regions receive a $250 bonus.
*  If a sales representative is assigned to a region that did not have a top-selling product for the year, they receive a goat.

| SalesRepID | Region |
|------------|--------|
| 1001       | North  |
| 2002       | North  |
| 3003       | South  |
| 4004       | South  |
| 5005       | East   |
| 6006       | West   |


| SalesQuarter | Region | Product |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Q1           | North  | A       |
| Q1           | North  | B       |
| Q1           | North  | C       |
| Q2           | North  | A       |
| Q2           | North  | B       |
| Q2           | South  | C       |
| Q3           | East   | D       |
| Q3           | North  | C       |
| Q3           | South  | E       |
| Q4           | North  | A       |
| Q4           | North  | C       |
| Q4           | South  | E       |

*  For Q1, the North region had all the top selling products, therefore reps 1001 and 2002 each get a $1000 commission for that quarter. The North region also had sales in Q2, Q3, and Q4, getting $250 for each of these quarters.
*  The South region had top selling products in Q2, Q3, and Q4, so they receive $750.
*  The East region had a top-selling product in Q3 only, so they receive $250.
*  The West region did not have any top-selling products for any of the quarters, therefore the sales reps get a goat as a commission.

Here is the SQL to produce the expected results.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #TopSellingProducts;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #SalesReps;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #CommissionsQuarter;
GO

CREATE TABLE #TopSellingProducts
(
SalesQuarter CHAR(2) NOT NULL,
Region  VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,

-------------------

('Q4','South','E');
GO

CREATE TABLE #SalesReps 
(
SalesRepID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,

);
GO

INSERT INTO #SalesReps (SalesRepID, Region) VALUES
(1001,'North'),
(2002,'North'),
(3003,'South'),
(4004,'South'),
(5005,'East'),
(6006,'West');
GO

WITH cte_SalesRepsQuarter AS
(
SELECT DISTINCT
       a.SalesRepID,
       a.Region,
       b.SalesQuarter
FROM   #SalesReps a CROSS JOIN
       #TopSellingProducts b
),
cte_CommissionALL AS
(
SELECT  CAST(1000.00 AS VARCHAR(10)) AS Commission,
        *
FROM    cte_SalesRepsQuarter a
WHERE   Region = ALL(SELECT Region FROM #TopSellingProducts b WHERE a.SalesQuarter = b.SalesQuarter)
)
----------------------------
SELECT  *
INTO    #CommissionsQuarter
FROM    cte_CommissionALL
UNION
----------------------------
SELECT  CAST(250.00 AS MONEY),
        *
FROM    cte_SalesRepsQuarter a
WHERE   Region IN (SELECT Region FROM #TopSellingProducts b WHERE a.SalesQuarter = b.SalesQuarter)
        AND
        NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM cte_CommissionALL b WHERE a.SalesRepID = b.SalesRepID AND a.SalesQuarter = b.SalesQuarter)
UNION
----------------------------
SELECT  NULL,
        SalesRepID,
        Region,
        NULL
FROM    cte_SalesRepsQuarter a
WHERE   Region NOT IN (SELECT Region FROM #TopSellingProducts)
ORDER BY SalesQuarter, SalesRepID, Region, Commission;
GO
----------------------------
SELECT  COALESCE(CAST(SUM(Commission) AS VARCHAR(100)),'Goat') AS Commission,
        SalesRepID,
        Region
FROM    #CommissionsQuarter
GROUP BY SalesRepID, Region
ORDER BY SalesRepID;
GO
```

### Example 2: Use Cases for = ALL

The task is to identify all Order Numbers that are linked to a single Item and have a "PROMO" discount value. If an Order Number is associated with multiple items, it should not be included in the result.

For example, Order Number 33 meets these criteria because it has a connection to one Item and all the products linked to it have a discount value of "PROMO." On the other hand, Order Number 11 does not meet the criteria as it is linked to two different Items.


| OrderNumber | Product  |  Discount |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 11          | Item1    | PROMO     |
| 11          | Item1    | PROMO     |
| 11          | Item1    | MARKDOWN  |
| 11          | Item2    | PROMO     |
| 22          | Item2    | \<NULL>   |
| 22          | Item3    | MARKDOWN  |
| 22          | Item3    | \<NULL>   |
| 33          | Item1    | PROMO     |
| 33          | Item1    | PROMO     |
| 33          | Item1    | PROMO     |

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ##OrderItem;
GO

CREATE TABLE ##OrderItem (
OrderNumber INT NOT NULL,
Item       VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
Discount   VARCHAR(255)
);
GO

INSERT INTO ##OrderItem (OrderNumber, Item, Discount)
VALUES (11, 'Item1', 'PROMO'),
       (11, 'Item1', 'PROMO'),
       (11, 'Item1', 'MARKDOWN'),
       (11, 'Item2', 'PROMO'),
       (22, 'Item2', NULL),
       (22, 'Item3', 'MARKDOWN'),
       (22, 'Item3', NULL),
       (33, 'Item1', 'PROMO'),
       (33, 'Item1', 'PROMO'),
       (33, 'Item1', 'PROMO');
GO

SELECT OrderNumber
FROM   ##OrderItem
WHERE  Discount = ALL (SELECT 'PROMO')
GROUP BY OrderNumber
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Item) = 1;
GO
```
