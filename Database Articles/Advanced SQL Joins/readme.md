# Welcome

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joining tables in SQL requires a good understanding of the data, the relationships between the tables, and the behavior of the different join types.  This GitHub repository covers advanced SQL join concepts and serves as a collection of interesting, odd, and uncommon ways you may encounter or think of joins in your everyday SQL work.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've tried to keep all my examples as concise as possible, and they should serve as a springboard for further exploration.  In this repository, several Markdown documents showcase different joins and concepts, and I try to show alternative ways to write SQL statements to better understand their behavior.  I have tried to create the documents so they can be read in any order without being repetitive, but I also provide a recommended reading order at the end of each document.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I will talk about the logical processing order and physical join types, any discussion about optimization and best practices is at a cursory level. I'm not trying to show best practices or optimization methods, but to provide a summary of the different joins you will encounter in your daily SQL activities, along with some of the odd and strange joins you may encounter.  To show the various joins, I use a small sample dataset that contains types of fruit that you can find in the `Sample Data.md` markdown file.  The sample data contains NULL markers but no duplicates.  Feel free to add, subtract, or modify the data and the provided queries to understand their behavior better.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome any corrections, additions, debates etc. I've tried to show different joins across all the major database platforms (not just Microsoft SQL Server), and I am sure there are some new and interesting joins I haven't included here (such as graph joins).
