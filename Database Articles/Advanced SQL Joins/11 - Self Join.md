# Self Joins

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Self-join in SQL is a join operation where a table is joined with itself. In a self-join, a table is aliased to give it a different name and then used twice in the same query, once as the left table and once as the right table. The join conditions in a self-join specify how to relate the rows of a table to itself. Self-joins can be used to compare rows within a table, create subsets of data based on certain conditions, or combine information from multiple rows within a table. The result of a self-join is a new table that contains the combined data from the two instances of the original table. Self-joins can be useful when working with hierarchical data or when analyzing data based on relationships within a table.

----------------------------------------------------

#### Example 1:  Hierarchical Relationships

Here is an example using a self-join on a hierarchy table.

For the following table of `Managers` and `Employees`, determine each employee's manager.

| Employee ID |      Title     | Manager ID |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 1           | President      | \<NULL>    |
| 2           | Vice President | 1          |
| 3           | Vice President | 1          |
| 4           | Director       | 2          |
| 5           | Director       | 3          |
  

Note the table `Employees` is referenced twice but given two different aliases named `a` and `b`.
 
```sql
SELECT  a.EmployeeID,
        a.Title,
        a.ManagerID,
        b.Title
FROM    Employees a INNER JOIN
        Employees b ON a.ManagerID = b.EmployeeID;
```

| EmployeeID  |      Title     | Manager ID  |      Title     |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| 2           | Vice President | 1           | President      |
| 3           | Vice President | 1           | President      |
| 4           | Director       | 2           | Vice President |
| 5           | Director       | 3           | Vice President |

It is worth mentioning that because the `Employees` table is a hierarchical relationship, the problem lends itself to using a self-referencing common table expression (CTE) to determine the level of depth each employee has from the highest tier.

In the below example, the common table expression `cte_Recursion` references itself in the `UNION ALL` statement.

```sql
WITH cte_Recursion AS
(
SELECT  EmployeeID, 
        Title,
        ManagerID,
        0 AS Depth
FROM    Employees
WHERE   ManagerID IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT  b.EmployeeID,
        b.Title,
        b.ManagerID,
        a.Depth + 1 AS Depth
FROM    cte_Recursion a INNER JOIN
        Employees b on a.EmployeeID = b.ManagerID
)
SELECT  a.EmployeeID,
        a.Title,
        a.ManagerID,
        b.Title AS ManagerTitle,
        a.Depth
FROM    cte_Recursion a LEFT JOIN
        Employees b ON a.ManagerID = b.EmployeeID
ORDER BY 1;
```
  

| Employee ID |     Title      | Manager ID | Manager Title  | Depth |
|-------------|----------------|------------|----------------|-------|
| 1           | President      | \<NULL>    | \<NULL>        | 0     |
| 2           | Vice President | 1          | President      | 1     |
| 3           | Vice President | 1          | President      | 1     |
| 4           | Director       | 2          | Vice President | 2     |
| 5           | Director       | 3          | Vice President | 2     |

----------------------------------------------------

#### Example 2: Finding Pairs

Here is another example problem that can be solved with a self-join.  Unlike the above problem, this table does not have a foreign key that references its primary key.

List all cities that have more than one customer along with the customer details.

| ID |   City    |
|----|-----------|
| 1  | Milwaukee |
| 2  | Detroit   |
| 3  | Dallas    |
| 4  | Detroit   |

  
The syntax to solve this puzzle with a self-join is shown below.
  
```sql
SELECT  a.ID,
        a.City
FROM    Customer a INNER JOIN
        Customer b ON a.City = b.City AND a.ID <> b.ID;
```
  
The above query uses a self-join and returns the following result set.
  
| ID |  City   |
|----|---------|
| 2  | Detroit |
| 4  | Detroit |

Because the `Customer` table does not have a foreign key relationship, the above query could (and most probably should) be written using the following syntax.  This statement is slightly more verbose, but the intent of the statement becomes a bit more obvious.

```sql
WITH cte_CountCity AS
(
SELECT  City
FROM    Cities
GROUP BY City
HAVING  COUNT(City) > 1
)
SELECT  a.*
FROM    Cities a
WHERE   City IN (SELECT City FROM cte_CountCity);
```

 ----------------------------------------------------
  
#### Example 3: Windowing

  
Often, if you need to use a self-join, you can use options (such as window functions) to avoid using a self-join. Letâ€™s look at an example.

Given the dataset below consisting of various animals' weight, create a cumulative total column summing the current row plus all previous rows.

| ID  |    Animal     | Weight |
|-----|---------------|--------|
| 1   | Elephant      | 13000  |
| 2   | Rhinoceros    | 8000  |
| 3   | Hippopotamus  | 3000  |
| 4   | Giraffe       | 2000  |
| 5   | Water Buffalo | 2000  |

```sql
SELECT  a.ID
        a.Animal,
        SUM(b.Weight) AS Cumulative_Weight
FROM    Animals a CROSS JOIN
        Animals b
WHERE   a.ID >= b.ID
GROUP BY a.ID, a.Animal;
```  
  

| ID |    Animal     | Cumulative Weight |
|----|---------------|-------------------|
| 1  | Elephant      | 13000             |
| 4  | Giraffe       | 26000             |
| 3  | Hippopotamus  | 24000             |
| 2  | Rhinoceros    | 21000             |
| 5  | Water Buffalo | 28000             |

However, a better way to write this statement is by using a windowing function.
  
```sql
SELECT  ID,
        Animal,
        SUM(Weight) OVER (ORDER BY ID ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS Cumulative_Weight
FROM    #Animals;  
```

----------------------------------------------------

#### Example 4: Relational Division
  
Self-joins are also used in relational division.

Given the following table of employees and their licenses, determine all employees with matching licenses.

| EmployeeID | License |
|------------|---------|
| 1001       | Class A |
| 1001       | Class B |
| 1001       | Class C |
| 2002       | Class A |
| 2002       | Class B |
| 2002       | Class C |
| 3003       | Class A |
| 3003       | Class D |
| 4004       | Class A |
| 4004       | Class B |
| 4004       | Class D |
| 5005       | Class A |
| 5005       | Class B |
| 5005       | Class D |

Here is the expected output; employees 1001 and 2002 have matching licenses, and employees 4004 and 5005 have matching licenses.
  
| EmployeeID_A | EmployeeID_B | LicenseCount |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1001         | 2002         | 3            |
| 2002         | 1001         | 3            |
| 4004         | 5005         | 3            |
| 5005         | 4004         | 3            |

The SQL to generate the expected output uses a self-join.
  
```sql
WITH cte_Count AS
(
SELECT  EmployeeID,
        COUNT(*) AS LicenseCount
FROM    Employees
GROUP BY EmployeeID
),
cte_CountWindow AS
(
SELECT  a.EmployeeID AS EmployeeID_A,
        b.EmployeeID AS EmployeeID_B,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY a.EmployeeID, b.EmployeeID) AS CountWindow
FROM    Employees a CROSS JOIN
        Employees b
WHERE   a.EmployeeID <> b.EmployeeID and a.License = b.License
)
SELECT  DISTINCT
        a.EmployeeID_A,
        a.EmployeeID_B,
        a.CountWindow AS LicenseCount
FROM    cte_CountWindow a INNER JOIN
        cte_Count b ON a.CountWindow = b.LicenseCount AND a.EmployeeID_A = b.EmployeeID INNER JOIN
        cte_Count c ON a.CountWindow = c.LicenseCount AND a.EmployeeID_B = c.EmployeeID;
```
----------------------------------------------------
  
#### Example of what is not a self-join.
  
The following are **not** considered self-joins.

Given a table of employees and their salaries, write an SQL statement to return all employees with a higher salary than the average salary of the company.
  
Although this SQL statement uses the `Employees` table twice, it does not join to itself.  In this example, the aggregation on the `Employees` table is used in the predicate logic and not joined to the `Employees` table.
  
```sql
SELECT  Name,
        Salary
FROM    Employees
GROUP BY Name, Salary
HAVING Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```
  
The following is also not a self-join.  The `cte_Average` does reference the Employees table, but it creates an entirely new relation consisting of {`Name`, `Average`}, which does not equal the original `Employees` table of {`Name`, `Salary`}.
  
```sql
WITH cte_Average AS
(
SELECT AVG(Salary) AS Average FROM Employees
)
SELECT  *
FROM    Employees a CROSS JOIN
        cte_Average b
WHERE   a.Salary > b.Average;
```
