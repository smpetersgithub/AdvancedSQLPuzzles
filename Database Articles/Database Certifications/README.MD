# Database Certification List

:star: If you enjoy this list, please consider giving my GitHub a star!

:exclamation: Note, I am no longer maintaining the original list that is found on my WordPress blog at (https://advancedsqlpuzzles.com). GitHub markdown language is simply easier to use and update.

ðŸ“« Feel free to message me with any certifications I have missed.  Additionally, some of these links will become inactive over time, and vendors are continually adding new certifications. Any assistance in keeping this information updated is greatly appreciated.

If anyone is interested in a list of database-related certifications, I have created one.

A couple of things first....

In the list below, I have included the most relevant certifications for a Database Developer, Data Engineer, or Database Administrator role. I've also included a few vendor-neutral certifications and a few from educational websites (which may not strictly fit the definition of a certification).

---

I also want to highlight that certifications and statements of accomplishments are two different things.

Certifications are acquired through testing agencies such as [PearsonVue](https://home.pearsonvue.com/) or [Kryterion](https://www.kryterion.com/), where you are administered a proctored exam with strict identity verification and exam rules. Upon successful completion, you will receive a digital badge to validate your credential. [Credly](https://info.credly.com/) is the largest issuer of digital credentials, creating, issuing, and managing them. Historically, you would go to an authorized testing center to take the exam; however, with COVID-19, these exams are now administered online, and proctoring takes place via webcam.

Statements of accomplishments do not have such strict guidelines and are issued after completing a course (such as a [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) or [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) class). Most of these are auto-filled forms that you can easily print and look great taped to your refrigerator. I often see educational websites marketing certifications, but these do not meet the strict rules of a certification. I have listed a few of these (from W3 Schools and Datacamp), and you may find them beneficial.

MariaDB offers a database administrator exam but not a developer exam.
