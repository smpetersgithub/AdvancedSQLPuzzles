# Database Dependency Analysis

Next, we'll analyze the results stored in the `sys.sql_expression_dependencies` view, based on the examples from the previous walkthrough.

This analysis uses the `foo.dbo.sql_expression_dependencies` table‚Äîa local table within the `foo` database‚Äîthat has been populated with dependency data from each example. To populate this table, please review the SQL scripts located in the GitHub repository.

[üìÑ The corresponding scripts for this walkthrough are available here.](https://github.com/smpetersgithub/AdvancedSQLPuzzles/tree/main/Database%20Articles/Database%20Dependencies/)

### Key Insights from Dependency Analysis

From our previous walkthrough‚Äîwhere we created each example and reviewed the `sys.sql_expression_dependency` view‚Äîthere are two key takeaways:

   * **`referencing_id` and `referenced_id` are not foreign keys to `sys.objects`**\
     Some dependencies listed in `sys.sql_expression_dependency`‚Äîsuch as XML schemas, user-defined table types, user-defined data types, server-level triggers, and database-level triggers‚Äîdo not correspond to entries in `sys.objects`. To retrieve additional details about these objects, you‚Äôll need to join with their respective system views (e.g., `sys.xml_schema_collections`, `sys.types`, etc.).
   * **Identifying invalid dependencies is not straightforward**\
     Invalid dependencies, such as a missing table referenced by a view or stored procedure (*Example 03*), are difficult to detect reliably. This is because certain patterns, such as cross-database dependencies (*Example 01*), stored procedures that call other stored procedures using only a one-part naming convention (*Example 06*), and object aliases (*Example 11*), can mimic the same behavior as broken or missing references.

To help identify invalid dependencies, the following SQL query can be used as a starting point. However, manual review of the results is necessary to determine which objects are truly invalid.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   sys.sql_expression_dependencies
WHERE  referenced_id IS NULL;
```

üîç In addition to identifying invalid objects, developers often need to understand object lineage and dependency depth. These topics will be covered in the next chapter.

### Additional Key Insights from the Analysis

Besides the previous key insights, I have found the following most relevant to understanding the `sys.sql_expression_dependencies` table.  These are presented in no particular order.

| Topic                         | Description                                                                                              | Examples          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Reference_ID Uniqueness       | `object_id` is unique only within a database. Use database, schema, and object name to match across DBs. | Example 01        |
| Stored Procedure Dependencies | Caller-dependent when using one-part naming, causing a NULL `referenced_id`.                             | Example 07        |
| Impossible Dependencies       | The table can report impossible dependencies, such as a view referencing a stored procedure.             | Example 09        |
| Object Aliases                | Show as invalid dependencies with NULL `referenced_id`.                                                  | Example 11        |
| Synonyms                      | Recorded only as referenced objects, not as referencing objects.                                         | Example 13        |
| Triggers in Dependencies      | DML, database-level, and server-level triggers are all recorded.                                         | Examples 14‚Äì16    |
| Sequences                     | Linked internally to a default constraint in the dependency table.                                       | Example 20        |
| Check Constraints / Computed  | Recorded as self-referencing objects.                                                                    | Examples 23,25    |
| Self-Referencing Tables       | Self-referencing objects are: computed columns, check constraints, filtered/XML indexes, and statistics. | Examples 25,28‚Äì30 |
| XML Methods                   | `value`, `exist`, `query`, `modify` repurpose dependency fields to show XML details.                     | Example 32        |
| Ambiguous Dependencies        | `is_ambiguous = 1` does not always mean unknown objects.                                                 | Examples 05,32    |
| Missing from `sys.objects`    | Database/server triggers, UDDTs, UDTTs, XML Schemas.                                                     | Multiple          |
| Missing from dependencies     | Synonyms (referencing), partition functions, defaults/rules, contracts/queues/message types, FKs, etc.   | Multiple          |
