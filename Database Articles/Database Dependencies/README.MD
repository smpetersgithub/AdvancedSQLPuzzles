# SQL Server Database Dependencies

The following documentation is designed to help developers understand the `sys.sql_expression_dependencies` table in Microsoft SQL Server. This repository includes an example walkthrough of various dependencies, how they interact with the `sys.sql_expression_dependencies` table, and the corresponding scripts essential for grasping this table's functionality and data representation. These scripts also serve as a comprehensive repository of dependencies, including some you may not have yet encountered or considered.

For this documentation, I chose to use GitBook, which can be accessed via the following link.
